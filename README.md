# freeCodeCamp Projects

This repository contains all the projects I’ve completed while learning through the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) platform. I’m currently working through the **Full Stack Developer** curriculum (new version), starting with the HTML section, and will also explore projects from the older certifications.

## 🧩 Project Overview

Projects will be added progressively as I complete each one. Each folder includes:
- A brief project description
- Source files
- Any relevant notes or documentation

## 🚀 Current Focus

- Full Stack Developer Curriculum (New)
  - Currently in the **HTML section**
  - First project: **Recipe Page**

## 📁 Structure

Projects will be grouped and organized by curriculum or topic (e.g., HTML, JavaScript, APIs, etc.) as the repository grows.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

As I progress, I’ll be working with:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Frontend libraries (e.g., React)
- Node.js and backend development
- Databases and APIs
- Testing and deployment tools
