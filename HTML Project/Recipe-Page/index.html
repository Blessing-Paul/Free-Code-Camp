    <h2>Instructions </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and season the assorted meat with salt, seasoning cubes, and onions. Boil until tender. Set aside the
            meat and reserve the stock.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix the ground egusi with a small amount of water to form a thick paste.</li>
        <li>Heat palm oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the egusi paste in small lumps and allow it to fry,
            stirring occasionally until it begins to curdle and looks slightly dry (about 10 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add the meat stock or water to the egusi and stir well to combine. Let it cook for another 5–10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add the cooked meat, stock fish, and dried fish. Stir and allow to simmer for 10 minutes so the flavors
            blend.</li>
        <li>Add crayfish, ground pepper, and more seasoning to taste. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the bitterleaf or ugu leaves and allow to simmer for another 5–7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Adjust salt and seasoning if necessary. Remove from heat and serve hot with pounded yam, fufu, or rice.</li>
    </ol>
